In this tutorial, you are going to build a storefront from scratch. A storefront is an e-commerce frontend application that enables customers to interact with your shop using various devices. It could be in the browser as a web application, on their phones through a mobile app, or even via custom devices, such as digital kiosks.

This tutorial is the fastest way to try out Saleor without installing it, with a keen focus on providing you with a high-level overview of the most important concepts, topics, and notions in Saleor.

In the following sections, we will walk you through setting up your very own Saleor Storefront while exploring key aspects ranging from product and performance optimizations to cart and checkout. Feel free to go section by section or hop around to the parts most relevant to your needs.
